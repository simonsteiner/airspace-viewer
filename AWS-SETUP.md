# AWS Free Tier Setup for Airspace Viewer

Deploy the Airspace Viewer application to AWS using **Free Tier eligible** resources ($0 cost for 12 months).

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **AWS Account** with Free Tier eligibility
2. **AWS CLI** installed: [Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
3. **Administrator Access** - IAM user with `AdministratorAccess` policy

### Create Admin User

You must have AWS Administrator access to create the deployment user and resources. This can be:

- Your root AWS account (not recommended for daily use)
- An IAM user with the `AdministratorAccess` policy attached

#### If you need to create an admin user

1. Go to [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
2. Click "Users" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Create user"
4. Enter username: `admin`
5. Select "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console" (optional)
6. Select "I want to create an IAM user"
7. Click "Next"
8. Click "Attach policies directly" and select:
   - `AdministratorAccess`
9. Click "Next" through remaining steps and "Create user"
10. Go to "Security credentials" tab and create access keys for CLI access

### Install AWS CLI

```bash
# verify installation
aws --version

# Configure with admin credentials
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Administrator Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Administrator Secret Access Key
# Enter your preferred region (e.g., eu-west-1)
# Enter output format (json)
```

**Note**: You'll use the deployment user credentials later for GitHub Actions, but the setup script needs admin access to create resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts Overview

| Script | Purpose | Requirements |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `setup-aws-user.sh` | Create deployment user | Admin access |
| `check-aws-resources.sh` | Check/manage resources | Any access |

## üöÄ Setup Steps

### 1. Set Up Admin Account

Ensure you have AWS Administrator access to create the deployment user and resources. This can be:

- Your root AWS account (not recommended for daily use)
- An IAM user with the `AdministratorAccess` policy attached

If you need to create an admin user, follow the steps in the [Prerequisites](#create-admin-user) section above.

Configure AWS CLI with admin credentials:

```bash
# Configure with admin credentials
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Administrator Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Administrator Secret Access Key
# Enter your preferred region (e.g., eu-west-1)
# Enter output format (json)
```

### 2. Create Deployment User

Create a dedicated IAM user for deployments with minimal required permissions:

```bash
chmod +x setup-aws-user.sh
./setup-aws-user.sh
```

This creates an IAM user with minimal permissions and saves credentials to `.secrets/deployment-credentials.txt`.

### 3. Deploy with EB CLI

The EB CLI provides a reliable deployment experience:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install EB CLI
pip install awsebcli --upgrade

# Verify installation
eb --version

# Initialize Elastic Beanstalk application
eb init -p python-3.12 airspace-viewer --region eu-west-1
eb init

# Create production environment (Free Tier: t2.micro, single instance)
eb create airspace-viewer-prod -v --timeout 15 --single

# Deploy the application
eb deploy
```

#### Useful EB CLI Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
eb status

# View detailed health information
eb health

# Get all logs
eb logs --all

# Deploy after making changes
eb deploy

# View environment variables
eb printenv

# SSH into instance (requires setup)
eb ssh --setup
eb ssh
```

### 4. Configure GitHub Actions (Optional)

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository (Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions):

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (from deployment user)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (from deployment user)
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` (generated automatically)

## üîç Management

```bash
chmod +x check-aws-resources.sh

# Check status
./check-aws-resources.sh

# List all environments
./check-aws-resources.sh list

# Clean up terminated environments
./check-aws-resources.sh cleanup
```

## üí° Free Tier Limits

- **EC2**: 750 hours/month of t2.micro instances
- **S3**: 5GB storage
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: No additional charges
